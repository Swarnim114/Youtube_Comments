14: Brings me back to the leafy days. Tbh I can’t watch more than 2 minutes.
15: 2:41 ok that made me laugh like crazy 🙏🏼😭
16: no way he mentioned hans neimann 😭😭😭
17: God how much cocaine are you consuming that you need to pump out brainrot content like this at such an alarming rate, bro ran through the whole valorant CC roster in like a week and said, goddamnit there's noone else to piggyback off of. Get a fuckin job dude
18: I think I bro watched a vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRVv_S3a5SY

21: NO THINK FOR USELF CMON💀💀
22:  @WestJett  u do it for us ur online more
23:  @WestJett  chatgpt said I should vote liberal. What do you think westjett?
24:  @WestJett  I am but a mindless sheep following my master, think for me westjett think for me
25: ​ @WestJett why the f u trash talking him then stop making us rethink our entire life choices then get mad over the It g
26: me and my preschooler brai every I hate _ video
27: ​​ @WestJett I liked the guy but u tell me he a dick he a dick
28:  @WestJett  YOU DO THE THINKING I WOULD SAY
29:  @WestJett 💀💀
30: You better
31: ​ @WestJett I have to listen/obey to my daddy
32: fr we stand behind westjett no matter what my brain left a while ago so i loyally worship westjett
33: The least parasocial westjett fan
34:  @glizzy9596  chatgpt is a commie socialist
35: type shi
36: my thoughts exactly
37:  @WestJett  ngl when I looked at the thumbnail and title I thougth it was TBYS
38: not only fell for ragebait but SWITCHED UP?! the mindless glazing is crazy
39: fr
40:  @glizzy9596  bro what
41: ​ @WestJett How dare you try to teach kids to think for themselves you will lose your job for this.
42:  @WestJett  we're not allowed an opinion after our mast posts 😔
43: bro is a follower huh 😂
44: I think for westjett westjett think for me
45: bro thinks hes tariq
46:  @WestJett you think for us 🙂‍↕️✋ if you have beef with on, we have to
47: ⁠Lmao
48: I mean if someone is trying to respond to stupid allegations like "only white men are in competition" then sorry but Ludwig is a dumbass. He should has never played into the hands of THOSE people. Shame on him. Also I don't trust anyone who at minimum does business with Hasanabi, ESPECIALLY if they are friends with this degen
49:  @WestJett  thats not what most ludwig viewers can do
50:  @Jackkarle  nah bruh how did i find you here i rememebr you from mineplex
51: UNDERSTAND MAN , The man got the bills to pay (westjett)
52:  @andrewk1938  bruh
53:  @WestJett  no thanks your opion is the best i was watching a ludwig video 30 sec ago now hes satan
54: I WORSHIP WESTJETT🙏🙏 HE IS THE ONLY ONE WITH RIGHT OPINION. ANYONE OPPOSING HIM SHALL BE REGARDED AS THE ACT OF BLASPHEMY AND REPENT FOR THEIR SINS🗣🗣❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
55:  @WestJett  I thought about it, am I crazy or was what you said in the video just be explained with saying "Ludwig regular dude, no want useless fight". 
People pretend they hate business attitude of just doing what is expected, but that is the easiest way to get things done. What's the point to expect that for a person to be "ideal" they should fight against every little thing that annoys them. At the end of the day it doesn't really change anything if ludwig posts those "apology" videos that are expected of him, but it sure saves a lot annoying unnecessary drama.

Imo fighting/arguments are glorified too much.
56: worst part, its valorant.
57: on the spine topic, is it spineless to reflect and correct one's actions? I think not
58: I love you westjett 😛
59: HANS NIEMANN MENTIONED
60: My man restarted the white guy drama thing on video two times to complete the 8 mins in video 💀
61: If you stand for nothing you’ll fall for everything
62: the empty side of valorant drama
63: Ngl, speedrunners are mostly white men from all of what I’ve seen.
64: plot twist: this is just westjetts way of a love letter to ludwig
65: 2 vids in 2 days crazy
66: trash video
67: "If somebody sees this photo, and their first thought is (to look) at the people by race, then they're already fully cooked".

Yeah dude it's unreal how racist a lot of these virtue signallers are. It's almost like this 'perfect' act that they do is used to cover for something... 🤔
68: atrioc mention poggies
69: westjett got more subs than jollz dark times
70: @WestJett do u actually hate him cause my yt subscription is based on who u like
71: Here I thought there was no voice of reason left in this forlorn world, however, the video is still comes somewhat one-dimensional for my tastes, though that aspect is expected provided its nature as an opinion piece. Either way, good work.
72: skibidi rizzler gyatt sigma ohio kai cenat baby gronk livy dunn fanum tax imposter side eye bombastic criminal offensive fortnite iPad kid beta male xD
73: Must say Ludwig’s “apology” was solid, I don’t think he folded to anyone and by saying “I didn’t have a quota to fill” and “they happen to be white”, it isn’t dodging any liberal hate, it’s just plain straight up and I like it.
74: what tier is the map bro's playing
75: Valorant so dead this guy is outsourcing clout to retired gold players💀
76: Walmart Looting Any % Speedrun
77: Are you going to cry :face-purple-crying::eyes-purple-crying:
78:  @makot0  yes
79: I started losing respect for Mogul Mail when he lied about the Tiktok Bin Laden stuff. It was like the prototype for the Hasan hard job incident.
80: You mention how it's fine to not have big opinions and just make content as a youtuber but then proceed to criticize Ludwig for that the whole video lol
81: Which surf game/server is in the background? I'd like to know
82: It's like looking at the champions leuge final and saying there's no women so it's racist
83: Next video - Why i love westjett (i hate him to death)
84: Ludwig sux never liked him
85: How does this have 111k views in a day. This is one of the worst vids I have seen on this platform lmao
86: ive officially found it
the brainrot hatecontent side of valorant youtube
87: Glad to see Leafy clone content is still being made.
88: WESTJETT LIVES RENT FREE IN MY HEAD, AND I LIKE IT <3
89: Had I not known about the story ahead of time, I would've stopped watching immediately after the Tom clip. You can't just gloss over the fact that Ludwig lied. You need to back it up with something tangible. Even clipping Hasan going apeshit over it would've worked wonders. The Tom clip was out of place
90: Careful West. Ludwig might see this and apologize to you bro.
91: this guy is posting anything at this point
92: Lmao, just invent stupid shit to be mad at him about just to see how many apologies we can goad out of him.
93: i just subscribed
94: i wanna see a video shitting on destiny
95: I don’t care if Ludwig isnt controversial in my opinion that just allows him to focus on his main goal making funny content although making a news is kinda weird when you can have the topic bully you into changing your thumbnail
96: 4:22 to be fair he probably was drunk in this clip he admitted he even admitted he was drunk his story time video about getting the streamer award
97: the entire population is westjetts opps
98: Bro took my advice
99: Look at the content you are making you have no right to speak
100: damn the why he was so cashule ablusist
101: I hate you and Ludwig go 0/1 irl
102: ludwig should of tweeted bc white is right and called it a day🧏‍♂
103: WestJett hating on one of the least hatable streamers is pure gold
104: if you dont respond your gay
105: Surprised you haven't talked about frogan aka hijabba the hutt
106: I m now a D1 hater of Ludwig as my eyes have been opened due to this inspirational video!!!!! Thanks eastplane❤
107: guys whos ludwig?
108: What a cheeseball.
109: you know a guy on the internet too much if u can hate him 😂
110: Ludwig the goat no arguing
111: I liked lud, now he is a soyjack no life loser
112: how you gon tell someone to stay in their lane as your out of yours💀 ''Valorant skin memery and "comedy"'' as you talk about a normal ass white guy on youtube that has maybe 3 valorant vids at most
113: the bigger you are on twitch the more scummy of a person you must be. Very few exceptions (loltyler1)
But this clowns crowd, and others, like mizkif, are straight up creeps
114: Have own opinion vs follow funny man is the battle between my 3 remaining brain cells (one is Switzerland)
115: Bro do you have a why i like this guy video 😂
116: this is what happens when you become a pr puppet and just pander to loud people on twitter. half the people upset with ludwig over the speedrunning thing didn’t even know what speedrunning was before this and they just apply their weird twitter morality to ludwig’s event, which is ludwig’s fucking fault because he’s built his whole career off of pandering to these fucking people. it’s a hole he dug himself into and now can’t escape his content fucking sucks and it might as well be on daytime tv with how soulless it is
117: destiny fan try not to bring up hasan challenge. bro made a whole video bc hes salty that ludwig didnt back him up. pathetic and parasocial. go out side and talk to a human being
118: Pls make a video on hassan being a bish
119: wesjett trying to act sly that critikal know who he is
120: 4:21 never seen thta clip but tf is he doing?
121: L take but take still respect it
122: I watched some of the content creator that you "dissed", they really fall off like jollz and jonas, many subscriber but low view, you on the other side keep the consistency, keep up the work
123: I agree with everything but i still like his content tbh
124: Lame idea for content
125: Personally I used to love Ludwig but he fell of faster than my grandma down the stairs
126: Prod is this u?
127: Bro needs to pay his rent can't argue with that.
anyways... Drop the OF🗣️
128: Poor critical though he was just trying to talk to the man
129: I watched Ludwig a lot and enjoyed his content in like 2021. He is unwatchable in 2024
130: I like mogul mail but i hate ludwig
131: Bro is burning bridges and creating enmities 😭
132: this is some good bait for ludwig fans lmao
133: didnt know ludwig lost his spine
134: i deadass thought ludwig was his username not his actual name
135: I mean, you can't blame the guy. He makes millions of dollars and with how the internet is you can lose everything in 1 slip up
136: Streamers became PR managers these days
137: Biggest Hater, fucking amazing
138: when no val drama 😂😂😂
139: It’s all over the screen WestJetty
140: Bro wants to be Leafy so bad
141: theres no way you got that good at surfing that quickly. that kitsune run is too good for you bro who u pay
142: Mom and Dad are fighting....
143: I went from kinda disliking you to binging your vids, some things just need the hard truth. Like this, this was dumb as shit lol
144: The autistic side of YouTube
145: hi west jett love u im subbed since u ranked sheirff
146: Who watch ludwig bruh💀
147: 8 min video mark for that extra bank. Truely a Venezuelan Trillionaire tactic.
148: He tested his own medicine😂😂😂
149: Westjett doing a Logan paul clipping shit out of context and trying to shit on ludwig
150: Lubetwig really lives to glaze.
151: W Moist for mentioning you. Need a collab
152: 7:55 "i don't hate ludwig" on a video titled Why I hate Ludwig. Westjett you might be the biggest fence sitter of them all.
153: i giggle on walmart looting speedrun
154: Ok the buttplug joke was actually something else💀
155: i wanted to kill my self and then i saw westjett and now i want to live bc his takes are so good no glaze lmao
also the firts part was a joke
🤣
156: i said this on twitter and I am saying it here again. Ludwig has been irrelevant since 2021
157: The last thing I thought when I saw that video was “ WHyWHITEoNLy “
158: more and more, i start to miss old 2015 youtube and the internet very deeply. holy shit,  it was pure freedom compared to now....
159: Ngl, i dont like your humour but the fact that the parts that are so cringe i need to skip are the parts when you show his streams is insane LOL
160: Tbh, I didn’t think Ludwig’s response video was that bad. But he needs to divorce Hasan ASAP
161: the acheeto side of valorant ranked
162: you and slime_machine have alot in common tbh hes also a D1 valorant hater
163: Westjett is love westjett is life
164: damn, i used to like ludwig and occasionally watch him. now i gotta hate him for this
165: Ludwig is not a good person.  Friends with anti American socialists.
166: It's too hard to read between the lies, could you please spell it out for us?
167: animal crossing goes hard tho gotta respect the female gamers for actually playing fun shi LMAO
168: Even destiny said Ludwig is a bitch for deleting that video
169: Ludwig is way too rich and famous for his intellect. But the first time I heard about this drama is the Tom Dark video and nothing can remind me how much I don't give a fuck than Turkey Tom. I literally don't care and think everybody is dumb as fuck. I'll remain a Ludwig fan because I like his content, everybody does braindead things and this isn't anything interesting.
170: bro needed the rent money fr
171: Cant wait for the "Why i hate westjett?" vid
172: The i hate everyone side of valorant
173: Dannng he’s going after the big boys now
174: He was drunk and trying to laugh at his girlfriends jokes that why he laughed a lot, qt could say some brain damaging joke and he’d still laugh
175: New Invertebrate discovered 🙃
176: what your uhh that outro song
177: i liked ludwig, still like him, people reaching for any drama they can lmao
178: This man hates on everyone 😭
179: ludwig is a such a coward lmfao
180: Yoo charlie watches westjett, actual crazy moment for the human race
181: ahaha I know it isnt or is he
182: Finally somebody called out this faker, tysm wj
183: 500k lets go
184: nahh why u got a valorant agent surfing on cs tho
185: Sorta unrelated, but i went into Averagejonas’ stream and said “jett from the west cooked you” i no joke got insta ban 😂😂
186: Hit the 8 minute mark
187: youtube asked me to play something random and this video showed up. thanks westjet for ruining my day!
188: Why tf is luigi getting roasted by a Valorant content creator🙏😭
189: i fvcken hate him
190: We getting to Acheeto with this one
191: Don't appreciate the Palestine joke
192: Man you need therapy. Super salty.
193: I'm too busy with my life to know whats up ima just hate ludwig cuz this Venezuelan trillionaire said so
194: Now I have to Ludwig as well. Thanks. I can't think for myself and rely on your and now you make me hate Ludwig. I hope you are happy.
195: the no backbone side of valorant
196: next video : Why I Hate Susan Wojcicki
197: bro at the end: i dont hate ludwig
bro as soon as ludwig is yapping about something for 5 seconds: time to title a video "Why I Hate Ludwig" and talk about twitter users and the hasan drama
198: destiny said one thing which makes so much sense now . when you are going to give a shelter to a particular audience like this ... after some time it will get turn on you
199: West Jett don’t miss
200: The spineless side of Youtube
201: Westjett is my roman empire. The heath ledger joker of my youtube algorithm
202: this guys entire career is being an edgy hateful loser and his channel is dying.
203: every time im a fan of someone, westjett has to peer pressure me to hate him 🙏
204: 2:35 100% true
205: honestly ludwig is one of the most funny content creators out there, the podcast he's on, the yard, is great
206: this isnt so skibidi anymore guys 😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏
207: When he rans out of valorant drama, time to shit on streamers now
208: Ngl west Jetts just makes me rethink on everything
209: to his credit that one video made one hell of an advertisement that no other dumbass advertisement could've ever done
210: The ending 😂😂😂
211: Nooo not the atrioc slander! He has has a great redemption :(
212: ludwigs is a good content creator and he makes good content why do we care about anything else haha
213: World gonna end and only thing that survives of our culture is a west Jett video. Aliens land on earth and watch it, decide to destroy planet
214: Ludwig tried to cook but he burn the food
215: Bro you hate everyone lmao
(Average sigma millionaire behaviour)
216: Bro like Eminem when ever someone says something to him bro makes a comeback with a banger video
217: Some people are just born haters I guess.
218: 3:59 is me
219: if you want to find beef always go west 😎
220: hes entertaining idrc i came here to enjoy, and about ludwigs take on shazam he just said ''i don't care'' which is respectable he just does not care nor does he wants to be involved. simple. And your 2nd thing about all male in speedrunning it was a mid apology by him but it doesn't mean that he was in the wrong it was just a bad apology
221: That Ukrainian flag turning into the Palestinian flag analogy is so true. Keep up the videos man 👍
222: Mf prolly gets pegged by qt
223: the more i see it, the more i realize that the facade that people putforth online is the opposite of what they are irl
224: To be real for a second, what you said to Shaz on Twitter was almost as bad as him copy-striking you. Ludwig's take makes sense.
225: I love the non related val content i hope everyone like it
226: if westjett ever clashed with penguinz0 idk who I would side
227: Bold of you to assume I have a wife
228: i mean ludwig is french so what do you expect
229: West jett is just entertaining I love beef
230: I love Ludwig but i absolutely hate that he's friends with such toxic people like Hassan and Pokimane.
231: people say hes a fence sitter but lwk i think all his takes are just pc its not a bad thing i think thats just how he feels
232: I just got done yelling at my wife! Time for some Westjett 🙌🏻🙌🏻
233: Congrats on 500k, now oil up
234: i hate ludwig now!!!!!!!
235: Did we make it? We have the same amount of subs as jollz?
236: ludwig
237: professional hater back at it again
238: ludwig
239: ludwig
240: ludwig
241: we beat jolls hell yeah
242: bro these video are getting short boy ! need more content. west we love your content ! 🥰🥰🥰😁😁😁. i don't even Know why is it your voice or the way you approach these Topics  or General point of view idk any ways Keep Going big big UP's
243: You just swinging for everyone nowadays, need Oprah video
244: Kappachungus
245: nah bro, there ain't nothing wrong with avoiding beef and having a good time in life. If anything you're the cooked one for spending time being mad at some internet guy
246: mic is so quiet
247: the hans nieman photo i’m dead💀💀😭
248: Always a good day when Westjett goes for that 8 minute mark for the bag. (He was generous this time to give us 10 more seconds in his video)
249: can’t believe westjett mentioned glizzy hands
250: you cut so much context, still a funny vid tho
251: Ludwig's choice to bounce on Hasan's D was his downfall fr
252: i got into a ranked game with ludwig and that mf bottom fragged and blamed me and my duo cuz we told him to stop lurking. Bro is just an asshole with 0 personality
253: u are NOT thomas white
254: will you ever diss pyrocynical
255: i don't get why he's still mainstream with a personality of wet cardboard
256: Ludwig’s falloff needs to be studied fr
257: Westjett for real the type of guy to make a diss track on every youtuber alive then make a Hate video on his own diss track.....Respect
258: I still don't know what happened with hasan, Westjett make a video or you will have a monsoon called apon you
259: no one asked who u hated lil jett :face-blue-smiling::face-purple-crying:
260: i think u will take a gambling sponsor faster than he took the fansly one
261: That would be a hate crime
262: I’m not mad tho. I’m farming money? I think ur the cooked one for writing a comment
263:  @WestJett  u care enough to reply to a 20 second comment my guy. But ur right, if money is your motivater then go ahead and dog on some guy for taking the high road. It gets clicks right?
264: it said tom dark before but i edited it to make it thomas white because thats his name i made a typo
265: For what
266:  @WestJett  He fell off, surely that's worth a diss
267: Yeah 100%
268: westjett is the Kendrick of youtube
269: westjett and jollz both at 501K subs, this is crazy
270: Is this not just the acheeto video? no hate just curious
271: awww man another acheeto clone. DISLIKE
272: bro you surf so fucking crazy
273: Contents getting lazy lol stop beefing with everyone you see and make something original.
274: I love that you created this community of where you can say whatever you want and no one can take your community. Been here since 5k 😂
275: babe westjett uploaded
276: i love you but palestine is no joke cmon people are getting burned to death
277: this westjett guy seems cool i think ima change all my existing opinions to his ones :)
278: Never liked the dude, I tried to watch his content but he was just so unfunny.
279: 7:50 bad example west bad example!! I like u but Im not a yes man I call out bad examples and f”ck ludwig
280: I am on the toilet lmao
281: how do you do the surfing in the background
282: We have THE SAME SUBS THAT JOLLZ HAS.  NFL music kicks in

Soon we will dethrone him >:D
283: "If you look at a picture and the first thing you see is race, you are fully cooked" this line made me soil my jocks
284: is this just a turkey tom video
285: The side job side of valorant because there's no new valorant drama.
286: Rare WestJett L
287: FINALLY SOMEONE SPEAKS THE TRUTH. I HATE LUDWIG IDK WHY HE IS POPULAR ?!?!?!
288: AIGHT GIVE ME IDEAS THEN
289: no >:(
290: 😂😂❤️
291: 🐐
292: 🐐
293: when your outro said “and don’t be a fool” i think i heard ludwig
294: never liked him ngl i have nothing against him i just think he has a stupid face.
295: dang time to hate on ludwig now
296: Nahh youre gonna get cooked by cringy streamy wacko
297: those who know what the burger king hat guy said 💀
298: As long as westy doesnt go after pewdiepie, we all good.
299: You know the rent is due if he dropping this
300: ludwig ain’t even that bad 😭
301: Bro evolved from Valorant and realized there is drama to capitalize from in real life
302: Lud didnt deserve hate, this is honestly just some modern day nonsense drama over a charity event. So what if the featured faces are predominantly white dudes esp when they're just overall famous/close friends of lud. He should prolly do a diversity feature poster soon to respond but eh
303: Bro is the leafy of valorant
304: Westjett is actually untouchable
305: We makin it over the 8 minute mark with this one 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
306: Can't hate Ludwig
307: How is talking to Charlie, is his voice as monotone as in the videos or nah
308: I'm gonna look like a total Ludwig supporter here, and I do watch a lot of Ludwig videos,  but i gotta kinda support him here. I agree that, if all of it is true, him deleting videos for hasan and all is hilarious, but half of your jokes were just clips of him that were taken out of context. Especially the laugh one. That one was obviously not meant to look real, and he even talked about it in a video, saying it wasn't real. The jokes are funny, but at least don't make things up. Also for the speed running thing... it was for charity, and it cost him a lot of money, so obviously he's gonna try to make people watch it  and like it again. Man this is half a novel
309: i need info about  the guy in the end
310: That's what happens when you try to please mentally acoustic regarded people on twitter.
311: Why would I go after the fucking legend
312:  @WestJett epic
313: I def missed the laugh being drunk thing. I new he was playing it up but lol
314:  @WestJett  i mean, a lot of it is probably persona. but the hasan thing i do not know anything about. could be true
315: I love bros intro
316: im in the smash community and i hate this guy so much
317: You have more subs than Jollz now
318: Gentlemen, time to buy westjett his groceries. Like and subscribe.
319: The turkey tom side of WestJett
320: On one hand if ludwig beefs back he's gonna break character on the other hand if he won't then it can be interpreted as agreeing with you. Well played westjett, well played
321: People launching coup d'etat left and right against popular celebrities 


Nice
322: THAT VELEZULIAN TRILIONARE
323: Say whatever you want about Ludwig, but don't disrespect Slime 8:01 😡😡That's my GOAT
324: Bro hit the 8 min mark lesssgooii
325: Valorant community is getting too good there hasnt been drama for like 2 days

335: Bruh 💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣 he’s a cry bully scumbag not a nice guy
336: I saw that 😂
337: Dude my premiere pro bugged out idk why
338: not only did he try to "research and disprove" tbys's vid
he disproved nothing, and his research was wrong or off topic
his points had no value and basically strawmanned the wrong arguments
im not a tbys superfan or anything but i dislike that both hasan and ludwig jumped into it and basically said a whole lot of nothing
339: At this point Just to be sure, make a video on who you actually don't hate 😆😆🤣
340: The only hasan video that i unironically watched was his melon crush by thighs vid. If lud is glazing him ,i can understand that qt is no way near hasan in that department
341: when gambling, u have a chance to win.
when donating money to onlyfans girls, u can only lose.
342: -_- missed the entire point of the response I see
343: I agree with most things you said and also one point being that Ludwig just shouldnt really "promote" the fact that he donated as a non political streamer, but Frogan was NOT cooking, ever
344: leftist-wig
345: omg wet jest our lord and savior has given us another rule to add to the book of skibidi, we must become harvard students and be super sigmas so we can continue to follow every one of his instructions and aim our toilets at all who oppose him. HEIL.
346: I think almost most of everything Ludwig does is sarcastic, and just likes to cover his ass 🤷‍♂️ most big public figures do it so.
347: Westjett: i have black friends

Me: and black viewers stay Frosty my vanilla swirl cupcake
348: bros gonna go after mrbeast next 💀
349: If you lose to hasan you need to retire asap
350: PeepIsAwesome clone
351: So is fansly an only fans rebrand or copy?
352: if westjetts hate them, i hate them
353: The dark side of youtube when? (even though we all know)
354: ppl realy be happyer when u hire and colab with black ppl cause they are black and not cause of anything else. Litraly suposed to go "oh, sorry, we cant accept you to our speedrun thingy cause we dont fill the black quota, and also the female one, and the asian one, also we need a homosexul and a terrorist, since we dont have enough of these." I am not rasist guys, trust me (checks how many black people are invited and cryes if it isnt atleast a half.)
355: 500k the only sigma side of valorant
356: I fucking hate you westjet but man you have banger takes ngl respect but disrespect lul
357: I was a hater of Ludwig since day 1 no soul no character
358: I made vids defending Critikal before
359: Tokenizing black friends is crazy 💀
360: i think the ludwig video that he posted about his speed running event made me respect him more, because he said that he didn’t want to advertise a bunch of token minorities because that’s cringe
361: Westjett into his leafy arc with this one 💀💀
362: Nah imagine ludwig made an apology video because of this 💀
363: "Why I hate ludwig"
in the video
"I dont hate ludwig"
Okay mr. Israel Pr team stop lying 😡😡😡😡
364: Honestly, he makes good content, I couldn't care less if he has a spine or not.
365: I can't wait for westjett to start hating on his past old videos 
Peak content
366: The only reason I watch you is for the goated Zelda fairy fountain theme
367: The spineless side of valorant 😢
368: We farming the views with this one 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
369: This guy doesn't stop complaining about anybody 😂
370: the walmart looting joke is hilarious
371: Never liked ludwig from the start anyway bro just looked like an average kids streamer when he used to make Minecraft and other games videos. And now I know about this it's become clear he was never a decent youtuber. Even in the chessboxing commentry Gotham carried the entire thing ludwig was just doing what you would call a reaction video, straight up lame
372: WOOOOAH 500k!
373: This dude gonna drop a video on his fiance soon
374: Atrioc mention!!!
375: I never understood why people even watch twitch streamers like Ludwig, XQC like they just sit in their assess saying "chat" a 100 times putting no effort into their content, contributing virtually nothing to society but still they make more in a year than most people do in their lifetime, atleast YouTubers like moistcritical has some good humor and good morals and most others I watch put genuine passion and effort into their effort but these guys genuinely don't deserve the fame they have
376: Never heard of him but thanks for letting me know to hate him
377: I haven't respected Ludwig since he disrespected my man Train for gambling
378: It’s so pathetic that he’s letting Hasan, who is pro-terrorists, own him like he’s his pet. He’s trying his hardest to please one of the most evil YouTube creators as of right now. 
When you’re close friends with Hasan you can’t be a morally good person. Not after everything he has said and done.
379: he also admitted that in the graphic he made he was putting people who had the largest audience
380: That is legendary
381: On god 💀
382: Gotham is goated
383: Can’t spell Ludwig without L
384: I didnt knew Charlie knew about you damn
385: I mean honestly I don´t really care I watch him for his funny content not for his moral standpoint or views of the world. And tbh cant really blame him for his way of doing things, no one really hates him, he dodges most shitstorms and he makes a shit ton of money.
386: Jesus must have? Hes already risen from the dead
387: So Is Ludwig a Communist Too
388: As someone who loves Ludwig, fuck that guy. Thank you westjett for always opening our eyes ❤️
389: West Jett is the only guy in would trust my kids to
390: What's the name of the game playing in background
391: At least he’s never made videos in Japan
392: But you missed a crucial detail, his apology make revenue, so bros getting a bag from the negativity.
393: W take but Ludwig still making good videos
394: bro i thought there would be a feet review at 500k?
395: 500k congrats get to 1 mill and you channel gets deleted
396: I liked ludwig. Still do because unlike some freaks i actually have my own opinions but those are some valid points
397: Wating for west jett to create a video against aspas ☠️
398: 2:07 actually paying for porn is better in this case because its cheaper than gambling lol. Though idk why anybody would even pay for it in the first place when there is a huge amount of it for free
399: The “buys $8 coffee from Starbucks and finds reasons to make their life harder” comment goes hard keep cookin’ lmao
400: Waiting for the video titled "Why I Hate WestJett"
401: Bro managed to make the vid 8 min for the ad rev somhow
402: idk i think although lud isnt perfect hes definitely earnt his space as a creator and is one of the rare few influencers who actually use their money to throw cool events
there are countless other creators who do things far worse and provide far less value to youtube
whole speedrun thing is also a giant nothing burger imo 
being mad at him for being a walking PR board is also dumb too- at this point man is just suffering from success (he is being paid millions for it and you all would too) 

rare L westjett video
403: I agree
404: Gambling is sigma
405: Always
406:  @WestJett  the bag comes first,like his apology before the drama
407: what is your name dudee lmao
408: 4:25 Why does bro look like that💀🙏
409: 6:00💀
410: Ludwig Van Beethoven?
411: I'm Pro palestine but the "trendy" part is so true. People just hop from one crisis to another and its crazy. They dont actually do research nor feel sympathy. Its all virtue signaling. I do wish people actually invested their time in doing research and feeling sympathy for the people who are suffering.
412: I love the implication that Barak Obama is your biggest hater
413: Westjett Hivemind commands us to hate ludwig lets go guys
414: Tbh I think his most recent video was fine. He even says later on that he already had other contestants (namely women and minorities) on, and he didn’t really even apologize; he just cleared things up.
415: West jett's Posture so good cause bro actually got spine
416: Ok, but honestly, I never liked Ludwig but I could never put my finger on why
417: bro is NOT Turkey Tom
418: No valorant drama in a bit, WestJett gotta make the bag differently now
419: It’s the pepper pains guy
420: This is the same problem I have with tarik. He's a good content creator and everything, but he looks at his chat to seek validation on his takes rather than just standing his ground and being honest.
421: not the kappachungus
422: No way westjett is leaching off of Ludwig now stick to Val buddy
423: i don't like westjett i love westjett
424: I'm a speedrunner and I agree with his message lmaooo😂 im dying
425: You titled it the  "dark" truth. It wasnt dark at all. I was able to see everything in the video just fine!!!!
426: you gotta go to league, you'll find content there
427: Babe wake up westjett posted
428: 1000% people have others do thinking for them
429: They’re scared of any backlash it’s sad
430: I own you
431: 😂😂 speedrunning is awesome though. What do you speed run?
432:  @WestJett  windjammer for the neo Geo, super ghouls and ghosts, duck tales , chip and dales rescue rangers and splatterhouse 1-3. Bro we speedrunner s have mental issues 😂😂😂 it's all love.  I appreciate you browski
433: You see the Netherim thing 💀
434: 4:24 why does he sound like mickey mouse LMAO
435: hmm... calling someone trying to be nice .. not have a backbone is weird to me ig
436: not when i started liking his stuff 😭
437: Next video “why I hate Jesus”
438: westjett either hates you or loves you, there's no in between
439: Whats fucked WEST JETT is that I watched this video after an argument with my gf while drinking Michelobs this was a personal attack.
440: Same, he wasn't the same after the atrioc drama.
441: damn white guys cant do stuff alone lol
442: I kinda get him though, its just easier to stay out pf drama and its good for the bag
443: Bro is godzilla
444: Brother, I enjoy when you review creators. It’s a cool way to get a quick summary of their style. However, this vid has so many inaccuracies it’s crazy. 
1. Ludwig was drunk at QT’s standup show, this explains his laugh 
2. Your whole career is built on dunking on Twitter freaks, why are you criticizing Ludwig for responding to them. 
3. Everyone agrees that his boxing event was amazingly well produced. 
4. Ludwig has dozens of videos where he gives his own opinion (popular or not) on current events (did you even look once at his second channel). This is the definition of having a backbone. 
5. You wasted about two minutes of this video on complaining that he didn’t care about your drama. The world does not revolve around you. If I don’t care about some random internet drama, that doesn’t make me a spineless person. 
6. I disagree with him promoting his fansly sponsor. However, this is America. He is an adult, he has the right to promote whatever he wants. Furthermore, he made a video going over his thought-process, which you failed to cover. 
The only valid point you have here is that changing the thumbnail of that one vid was a scummy thing to do. The other 6 minutes of this video is literally tabloid journalism.
445: Surprising how  in 1 hour 17 k people have viewed this video
446: bruh who tf are you even making the video on? Disliked..
447: westjett idk what you'll do in life later on , do not stop making vids , i need my dinner time roasting entertainment 💀
448: HI
449: Remember to censor his eyes with a black bar next time
450: When the worst person you know made a really good point
🤯🤯🤯
451: @WestJett tell me someone you don't hate..
452: I agree that it is unnecessary for him to apologize or even address the situation but on the other hand ………

It is free publicity
453: I mean u can call it being a p..sy or being smart considering all the haters
454: You don’t see it. Probably think AverageJonas is a good guy lol
455: LMAO
456:  @WestJett  do you love me daddy westjett?
457: My career was built on Valorant skins actually 💀😭
458: ok
459:  @WestJett  My brother in Christ, how long has it been since you’ve made a skin video. Also, you didn’t address any of my points. You are a funny guy, please don’t resort to making scummy videos in order to keep your career afloat.
460: Shame he's a hasan d rider, i still like his content even if it's cliche youtube slop
461: Westjett whimpering audio when?
462: bro was yapping so fast at the start
463: Jail
464: ​ @WestJett soap picking side of valorant
465: i genuinely dont know why you are upset about this
466: unrelated and irrelevant
467:  @ponipappa414  why bring an of model and talk about her give her a platform to promote doesn't he always go talking bad about onlyfans what about now .
468: You’re a moron
469: Which one
470: Not the Atrioc clip at the end 😭
471: 4:00 "you get home, get a beer, beat your wife and watch a west jett video" litterally me but have no wife or gf
472: Can you do OTK next
473: I somehow manage to be a Westjett fan and a Ludwig fan at the same time. Still hate Hasan though
474: Poor Atrioc bro did 1 mistake his entire career and he gets more strays than slime
475: man somepeople really lake a brain 💀
476: bro im black and i give u the n word pass ur chill
477: Unironically one of the blandest MFers alive. But then again I suppose it's the only way to come out the Smash comunity unscathed.
478: westjett  making a video on ludwig is like mouse biting a lion whos sleeping
479: Bro westjett is the biggest hater, he hates the way that he walks, the way that he talks, he hates the way that he dresses, he hates the way that he sneak disses, if he catches a flight it’s gonna be direct, we hate the way that the women he plays with confuses themselves with real women and notice he said “we” it’s not just he, it’s what the community feelin.
480: I started watching ludwig late 2018 and was a big fan for years. It definitely was after joining youtube that he just started pandering to political and social issues lime crazy. You couldnt go through a single video without him bringing up how hard female streamers have. dude became a bitch.
481: If I got a dollar every time this man stated a fact, I'd have a hella lot of dollars
482: i thought i was the only one bro
483: Westjett talking about Ludwig only because he needs money for his crippling fentanyl addiction 😂🙏
484: As a fan of Ludwig and Westjett, I couldn’t care less that he doesn’t have a spine. You’ll still be catching me watching slop
485: I didnt even know about the fansly thing, as if getting into debt and have gamblin addiction and alcohol consumption is any better than paying to rub a quickie 💀 

Never been a huge ludwig watcher because he has no opinion and if he has one its dictated by people he associates with.
486: watched ludwig for years, and he is 100% just hasan's bitch now.
487: Being hated by someone like you and all these other lame drama channels gotta be a sign that you're a good person
488: Westjett can't be racist cuz his wifes boyfriend black
489: I dont like ludwig but you cant diss him for taking a fansly sponsorship when you took a gambling sponsorship even tho your viewerbase is probably younger than his
490: Based. You can do both
491: true, but it was a big mistake
492:  @sonicx254shere3 he also had a goated apology. Not the first one where he his crying with his wife, that was the worst choice he could’ve made, but his 6 month update video was the best YouTuber apology I’ve ever seen.
493:  @VGbeck22  omg thankss I'll check it out, I didn't know, that's really nice of him. It's easy to dog in youtuber apologies for being bad but I've made terrible apologies irl myself, so a good apology- YouTube or otherwise, is quite rare, respect++
494: he wins in all cenarios tho, even if he gets cooked he will get a lot of views
495: The guy lost a 4 v 1 with tbys
496: I mean lion in like popularity btw
497:  @xxalekfumantexx8737  scenarios
498:  @Caped__Baldy  🤓☝
499: ​ @xxalekfumantexx8737  yeah, you're a child
500:  @Caped__Baldy  wow, when i grow up, i want to be just like you bro, hoeless and resorting to call others a child on the internet, over a nerd emoji.
501: LOL ur a freak. I’d be willing to bet thousands
502:  @WestJett  Oh no, anyways
503: It was not about that lud took fansly sponsor but the fact that he took a fansly sponsor and tried to spinn it as if its not another carbon copy of every other site that has paid corn and its the majority of the sites content and as if gambling and alcohol consumption was any better like he insuniaited.
504: I didn’t hate on him. I hated on his argument
505: bro you gotta lmk what game ur surfing in
Edit: if you dont we got more beef than you and averagejonas
506: Why is this vid so quiet mf
507: Bro at this point you hate everybody and that's right 🙂
508: Ermm, What dah sigma?
509: Unironically saying cracker in 2024 and thinking ur cool 😂
510: Ludwig losing aura
511: WestJett probably has beef with some single mom in Africa
512: Haven't seen a female speed runner or a female trophy hunter
513: 1:45 the laundry owner in Family Guy
514: Damn I liked ludwig. Guess i gotta hate him now. Shame
515: bro is a professional hater, also whats the game u play in bg my lord
516: it has been mnths since i actually laughed out loud at a video watching by my self and what cracked me was 2:40 "walmart looting any%"
517: lessgoooooo you have more subs than jollz now!!!!!!!!!
518: So my man Ludwig just needs to grow a pair? Fair enough.
519: Bad take imo
520: the world FINALLY makes sense again, WestJett finally got more subs than Jollz
521: Actually wild how upset people were at the lack of "diversity" in his speedrunning event. I don't think people on twitter realise the aspect ratio of male vs female speedrunners, and I can't really think of any minority speedrunners at the top of my head (then again, I don't have the attention span to watch Twitch so I wouldn't know). At least bro got Liam in there, so he gets an A for effort for some diversity in the roster💀👍
522: There is no Jollz sub count CUS WE BEAT HIM YEAAAAAA BABBYYYY
523: the spineless side of valorant
524: 4:44
how can charlie always be a w
525: NO THINK FOR USELF CMON💀💀
526:  @WestJett  u do it for us ur online more
527:  @WestJett  chatgpt said I should vote liberal. What do you think westjett?
528:  @WestJett  I am but a mindless sheep following my master, think for me westjett think for me
529: ​ @WestJett why the f u trash talking him then stop making us rethink our entire life choices then get mad over the It g
530: me and my preschooler brai every I hate _ video
531: ​​ @WestJett I liked the guy but u tell me he a dick he a dick
532:  @WestJett  YOU DO THE THINKING I WOULD SAY
533:  @WestJett 💀💀
534: You better
535: ​ @WestJett I have to listen/obey to my daddy
536: fr we stand behind westjett no matter what my brain left a while ago so i loyally worship westjett
537: The least parasocial westjett fan
538:  @glizzy9596  chatgpt is a commie socialist
539: type shi
540: my thoughts exactly
541:  @WestJett  ngl when I looked at the thumbnail and title I thougth it was TBYS
542: not only fell for ragebait but SWITCHED UP?! the mindless glazing is crazy
543: fr
544:  @glizzy9596  bro what
545: ​ @WestJett How dare you try to teach kids to think for themselves you will lose your job for this.
546:  @WestJett  we're not allowed an opinion after our mast posts 😔
547: bro is a follower huh 😂
548: I think for westjett westjett think for me
549: bro thinks hes tariq
550:  @WestJett you think for us 🙂‍↕️✋ if you have beef with on, we have to
551: ⁠Lmao
552: I mean if someone is trying to respond to stupid allegations like "only white men are in competition" then sorry but Ludwig is a dumbass. He should has never played into the hands of THOSE people. Shame on him. Also I don't trust anyone who at minimum does business with Hasanabi, ESPECIALLY if they are friends with this degen
553:  @WestJett  thats not what most ludwig viewers can do
554:  @Jackkarle  nah bruh how did i find you here i rememebr you from mineplex
555: UNDERSTAND MAN , The man got the bills to pay (westjett)
556:  @andrewk1938  bruh
557:  @WestJett  no thanks your opion is the best i was watching a ludwig video 30 sec ago now hes satan
558: I WORSHIP WESTJETT🙏🙏 HE IS THE ONLY ONE WITH RIGHT OPINION. ANYONE OPPOSING HIM SHALL BE REGARDED AS THE ACT OF BLASPHEMY AND REPENT FOR THEIR SINS🗣🗣❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
559:  @WestJett  I thought about it, am I crazy or was what you said in the video just be explained with saying "Ludwig regular dude, no want useless fight". 
People pretend they hate business attitude of just doing what is expected, but that is the easiest way to get things done. What's the point to expect that for a person to be "ideal" they should fight against every little thing that annoys them. At the end of the day it doesn't really change anything if ludwig posts those "apology" videos that are expected of him, but it sure saves a lot annoying unnecessary drama.

Imo fighting/arguments are glorified too much.
560: Which part 💀 there was like 6
561: Ludwig is a business owner and multiple people depend on him and his reputation, so he just tries to be entertaining and I don't think it's a good move to be yourself or put forward all your honest thoughts on the internet as that polarizes the audience and lower the views. That does not mean that he has no backbone, this video just seems like a ramble about nothing just to seek some relevancy.
562: Wait u share politic opinion that u hate obama omg finally
563: and you're like his polar opposite
564: 500k? Chest reveal?
565: How can you be so obnoxious yet so based
566: Glad to see you spread your wings and hate outside the valorant community as well LOL
567: Next people cancelling the olympics cause there are no women in mens games
568: Oh U Hate Him?? Me Too:face-blue-smiling:
569: The Ukraine to Palestine part caught me off gaurd G 💀 Anyways Free Palestine 🇵🇸
570: bros slowly going from valorant creators to everyone
571: No one cares
572: I feel like you didn't cook him as hard as you usually do but it is what it is
573: new week new opp
574: Ive been saying it for years but Ludwig and a ton of his butt buddy streamer buddies come off so fake and gay. Mad cringe spineless virtue signalers. Then you have his gf QT who i think is even more fucking annoying
575: When is the feet reveal you promised at 500k
576: bro hates everyone
577: 2:40 I'm black and this is true.
578: Nah Ludwig is goated
579: Bto stop you might gonna run out of oopp
580: These creators should just believe what they believe...
581: If you cant be yourself because there might be backlash then you hang in with the wrong crowd. Most of those who arent just another copy of every other family friendly youtubers can and are themselfs on camera. 

Being a busines owner doesnt mean your opinions and actions should be catered or influenced by people around you. If you do that you come off as a 'fake' or in this case a fence sitter who just parrots the most progressive narrative and opinions to keep being on peoples 'good side' IE Hasan and so on.

Edit: also its funny how you try to spin this to westjett having to seek relevancy when you look his posts its evident hes already relevant 💀
582: bet you love watching wwe and adam sandler movies
583: I feel like tarik is the ludwig of valorant but honestly tarik is much better
584: yoo
585: worst type of people on the internet are performative losers who don't actually care about the issue they're supposedly support
586: Bro adding in the "black friends" reference like he typin hesoyam in san andreas 💀
587: I
588: close enough drop new video peepisawesome
589: Who tf gives a shit if there’s women or minorities in a competition? Same people don’t want men in women’s sports and this is the same kinda no?
590: >why I hate Ludwig
> 7:55
8 minutes spent for nothing
591: cmon ludwig is good ;)
592: meow
593: ludwig is the tarik of youtube streaming
594: The Valorant side of Ludwig
595: westjett try not to say virtue signal challenge impossible
596: I like this yap, keep going xd
597: L take
598: didn't like TomDark make the same video a week ago 💀
599: finally people are turning on him. He is so fake and unfunny.
600: erm what the sigma?
601: stop hating, start disliking westjett😭
602: Free Palestine Tho🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
603: I own peep
604:  @WestJett  definently
605: LMAO hates a strong aord
606: ludwig peaked when he said he dosent want to be my friend
607: Can't wait for ludwig sunnyv2 video
608: Ludwig is The rock of YT. Just fake people with no actual independent thoughts or opinions.
609: The Valorant content is over side of Valorant
610: Title: Why I Hate Ludwig
WestJett: 7:55
611: Lately, I've seen Ludwig as someone who doesn't think for himself and just panders for his own audience. Funny enough, even I have to agree with the liberal beta Destiny about Ludwig and that's sickening.
612: Nice to see you catch up to jollz..... We are going to surpass him!!!!!!!
613: I just saw, finally you have passed jollz congrats buddy.
614: WE ARE SO CLOSE TO DEFEATING JILLZ
615: Now will we see cck side of streamers (*maybe i went a bit too far)
616: I am Indian pin me
617: redbull + westjett best combo
618: Ryōiki Tenkai : Infinite Beef
619: Is this you surfing or nah? I'm tweaking over this
620: East Jett Posted
621: are you christian
622: westjett after everyone and their family💀
623: almost passing jollztv 💪
624: The mario bros side of valorant
625: Totally agree. Ludwig is decently entertaining and it’s fun to just watch one of his videos every once in a while. He is dick riding the shit out of hasan though. He should start is own path 100%
626: this man is like aaron burr on steroids
627: LMAO would go hard
628: Not me lol
629: Ahh the double fraud
630: The legend made a video about Ludwig. Lol, didn't watch the video yet, but how long did it take you? You said that it would take forever to make a video on him, when I asked you a couple videos ago, so just curious.
631: slime is peak, nah but fr ludwig for me hasn't been the same since like 2022, bro just lost more and more respect and he just isn't the same youtuber who I enjoyed watching
632: Honestly i don't care about this drama cuz im a sigma!
633: Ludwik
634: why do we give these weirdos on twitter any credit or attention to begin with 😮‍💨
635: am i tweaking or is ur voice quieter than normal in this video?
636: Man you never disappoint. I just discovered your channel and was thinking "damn you should upload more often, for example upload a vid today". And you did. Bless you bro 😁

Also- wtf I had to edit the comment because I messed up first sentence. I was too tired probably
637: By this rate Westjetts gonna run out of opps
638: You making this video about how pointless his video is and you make a pointless video
639: Make a video about peep
640: At 4:20 Ludwig was drunk af which is why he was laughing so hard at the joke.
641: YOOOOOO THE FACT THAT CHARLIE SIDED WITH YOU IS A W MAN LESSGOOOOO!!!
642: Atrioc slander will not be tolerated. Rare WestJet L
643: Extremely rare L, bro just wants to stay out, respect ur opinion tho
644: criticizing ludwig for being annoying < criticizing him for his race
645: Did rent go up WestJett?
646: Westjett and Jollz both have 501k subs Rn WE NEED EVERYONE TO SUB
647: Chill out WestJett
648: 3000 in 10 mins?  Fell off. Git gud
649: get ur viewers up not ur funny up
650: Even though he shot a random stray at me, is bald, still better than Ludwig 💀
651: so real , i used to really like him but idk i feel like i dont respect him as a human anymore . slime is a chad tho
652: Facts, the days when he would stream some random stuff without a plan and just be geniune, now everything is so staged and forced, pandering to every side possible
653:  @WestJett  ong he is, banned from his twitch tho
654: yeah, I don't really watch the stream anymore; the podcast is still funny though
655:  @user-lt4ne7mc4i   Both are vile human beings. Look at how Slime slandered Destiny when he was sitting with Ludwig and friends behind his back at same old talking points without any arguments and with full on arrogance.
656: Okay that gives it a pass 💀 if he did that fully sober
657:  @WestJett  damn, wasn't expecting a response. Props to you though for actually reading your comments.

I personally think Ludwig has a unique style of content creation, which honestly all successful YouTubers do. He just has his own quirks here and there that his fanbase likes.

Also, if he stood up for himself, he'd get even more flame, and I for one think he handled it perfectly. He ain't no WestJett after all 🔥🔥🔥
658: ​ @rifatbari7674  I used to watch him but after noticing how he has no backbone at all I stopped
659: jesus christ im watching westjett vids 13m after he posts i need to get a life
660: ludwig is literally just a guy that tries to 
disguise as a god (ignore my name)
661: How do you feel  knowing that your channel is fueled by content beefing with other creators
662: I don’t like him as a creator, but I think he does host good events.
663: Is there every gonna be a video of you liking someone in the thumbnail? XD
664: The beef with everything side of valorant
665: 4:59 cold af
666: any info on the frtingglitter twitter situation?
667: Ok but who actually cares😂

I'm just here for the roasts and insults to laugh at
668: At 4:20 Ludwig was drunk af which is why he was laughing so hard at the joke.
669: The dark side of emotional scoliosis
670: WestJett? More like EastPlane
671: Pulling the "I have black friends" is wild💀💀
672: and hes boring af
673: congrats on 500k G
674: new intro idea: wsg stranger things mind flayers and castrated masturbaters
675: The fence side of youtube ranked
676: why does bro hate everyone😭
677: The yapping side of youtube
678: Wesjett dont think we forgot about the feet reveal
679: 2k views in 8 minutes? bro fell off
680: I think he is proud about it.
681: Maybe 💀💀
682: it also looks satirically forced no? like when he was hitting him on the back
683: he was just fake laughing at his unfunny GF's joke.
684:  @dariusgarlandbf  in a video he reacted to the awards thing and said that he was drinking a ton
685: I have yet to see a good argument against it 💀🤣
686:  @WestJett  fr I don't understand how this is not a valid argument to prove you aren't racist as long as the friendships are genuine ofc
687: shit lowk had me dead 💀
688: i was reading this while he was saying that lol
689: i never understood why ,,i have black friends,, isn't valid lol
690:  @pufu1749  psst hes joking
691: Thanks g
692: The no backbone side of Valorant
693: he's super sigma just like william willius
694: Bro loves to hate
695: Name one person Who isnt an opp of westjett i dare you
696: stop hating venezuela hate argentina now  they economy is almost equal (im argentinian)
697: The Ludwig side of valorant
698: Tbh I think ludwig is like this is because of qt and it's hasan who's influencing her
699: 6 mins ago my life was sad
But now i have you
700: Westjett atp is like adolf hitler picking fights with everyone
701: 5 min and 1k views bro climbed up
702: I don't like him because he tends to worry if someone is offended by him. For example, with HasanAbi, he made a valid video on him and HasanAbi somehow took offense to it. Then Ludwig just reposted the video with a different thumbnail or even removed it because his friend rightfully criticized him. Stick to your opinion!
703: Ludwig aint stand on budniss!
704: This is why we like mogul mail
705: The sellout side of... wait this ain't Valorant 💀
706: I haven't watched the video but I predict a mention of the fansly sponsored boxing match (if westjett didn't mention it it would low key be fraud)
707: he "made" him change the thumbnail? imagine lmaooo
708: the beef side of valorant
edit: bro did not just put atrioc in the outro 💀
709: the dark side of WestJetts unoriginal comment section
710: honestly smash hupty dumbty, but pass ludwig
711: Bro is after every youtuber
712: Critical is chill
713:  @WestJett  the Goat responded
714: Jesus within the first 20s 💀💀

717: no way bro is beefing with mario's brother
718: This is one of the worst videos I’ve ever watched
719: WestJett >Jollz(The WestJett side of Valorant Arc started)
720: Bro hates
721: bro's entire channel is him and other youtubers having beef
722: The no valorant content ideas side of valorant :D
723: Dam
724: Ludwig is the guy in cartoons that when he dies his soul would float slowly towards the sky with a halo
725: when westjett needs money but there is no valorant drama
726: Loll
727: I thought I was alone.
728: i like turtles

739: fr tho
740: Well they were talking about the shazam drama thing so technically its related to him
741: Bro just creates his own beef
742: IKR
743: I feel like his whole persona feels inauthentic, idrc about the other shit it just doesn't feel real
744: He played valorant with Tarik for a little bit and I remember thinking this guy has no personality and isn't funny at all. I don't actively dislike Ludwig or anything, I just don't get how anyone could actively watch his content
745: Weeeee another west jett upload
746: one day westjett will hate on every youtuber alive
747: Bro you are finally about to beat Jollz. Congrats on the 500K my favourite white N-word machine💀

770: "HAS" sorry my german instincts kicked  and I became a grammar nazi
771: ​ @alle_edits xd
772: he just wants to get views
773: for no reason too
774: beefing with people bigger than you is a good way to bait views and a reaction
775: ​ @skelebro9999  echidna!!!
776: westjett is one of those people who thinks he's better than everyone else, that's why all his content are just pointing out other people's flaws and imperfections, or atleast in his narcissistic eyes. like literally all he do is criticize
777:  @SeanDanielDelMar yes you are right  but that’s his content to make fun of people to entertain. Kind of a rost video
778: Also he just picks the most insane takes from the opposite side and somehow they still look more reasonable compared to his insane ramblings
779: Too far
